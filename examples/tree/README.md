# UI for Creating Trees

Start creating a tree by specifying a path or clicking the
"Add Example Data" button.

Paths are lists of colon-delimited values. A node at depth _i_ has _i_
digits, and a node's value uniquely determines its path. The entire
path must be specified as input.

Sample Inputs:

```
1:12:123
4:42:425
```
